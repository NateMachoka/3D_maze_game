# 3D Maze Game

## Project Overview

This project is a 3D first-person maze game built using C and SDL2. The game starts as a 2D maze and will eventually evolve into a 3D experience using raycasting techniques. Players will navigate through the maze, with plans to introduce enemies, weapons, and interactive elements as development progresses.

## Features

- **2D Maze Exploration:** Start with a 2D top-down view of the maze.
- **First-Person Perspective:** Transition to a 3D first-person perspective using raycasting.
- **Player Movement:** Navigate the maze using the WASD keys.
- **Basic Enemy Interaction:** Plan to add enemies that will interact with the player.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Smooth rendering of the game environment using SDL2.
